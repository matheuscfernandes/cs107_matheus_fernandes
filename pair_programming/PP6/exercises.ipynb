    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "You will work with the following function for this exercise,\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  f\\left(x,y\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\sin\\left(x\\right) - \\cos\\left(y\\right)\\right)^{2}\\right).\n",

    "   - Note:  This graph will have $2$ inputs.\n",
    "2. Create the evaluation trace for this function.\n",
    "3. Use the graph / trace to evaluate $f\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}, \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$.\n",
    "3. Compute $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}, \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\left(\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}, \\dfrac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ using the forward mode of AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hint\n",
    "You can set up a table with the following headings:\n",
    "\n",
    "| trace   | elem op.    | value | elem der.           | $\\nabla_{x}$| $\\nabla_{y}$ |\n",
    "| :---:   | :------:    | :---: | :-------:           | :---------: | :----------: |\n",
    "| $v_{2}$ | $x_{2}^{2}$ | $1$   | $2x_{2}\\dot{x}_{2}$ | $1$         | $2$          |\n",
    "| $v_{3}$ | $v_{2}^{2}$ | $1$   | $2v_{2}\\dot{v}_{2}$ | $2$         | $4$          |\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key observations:\n",
    "* First of all, the values in the table is made up and for purely illustrative purposes.\n",
    "* The first column represents where you are in tracing out the computation.\n",
    "* The second column is the current elementary operation. In this example, we're just squaring one of the inputs.\n",
    "* The third column is the value of the function at this point in the evaluation. Here we're just pretending it's $1$.\n",
    "* The fourth column is the derivative of the elementary funtion. This is where the chain rule happens!\n",
    "* The fifth and sixth columns are where things get interesting:\n",
    "    * Fifth column. The derivative value evaluated from the fourth column where the dot is interpreted as a derivative with respect to $x$.\n",
    "    * Sixth column. The derivative value evaluated from the fourth column where the dot is interpreted as a derivative with respect to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example, we need to calculate $2v_{2}\\dot{v}_{2}$. From the previous row, we see that $\\dot{v}_{2}$ could be $1$ or $2$ depending on which derivative the dot represents! In our $\\nabla_{x}$ column, we know that the dot means derivatives with respect to $x$ and in our $\\nabla_{y}$ column we know that the dot means derivatives with respect to $y$. Plugging the appropriate values in from the previous row gives us the right values.\n",
