    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Suppose we want to add a feature to our repo.  We'll create a new branch to work on that feature, but we don't want this branch to be long-lived. We plan for this branch to be deleted soon after we merge the changes into `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will work in the root directory of your course repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new branch called `feature_branch` and switch to this new branch.\n",
    "2. Type `git branch` to make sure you're on this new branch.\n",
    "3. Edit your `README.md` by including a subsection (level 2 Markdown header) called `Content`.  Under the `Content` section, create a bulleted list where each bullet is a directory name (e.g. `lectures`, `homeworks`, `pair_programming`, etc).  Provide a one-sentence description next to each bullet title.\n",
    "4. Type `git status` to see the state of your local repo after you made these changes.\n",
    "5. Stage and commit your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pause. At this point, you've committed your new feature to your `feature_branch` in your local repo.  Presumably it's all tested and everything is working nicely. You'd like to merge it into your `master` branch now. First, you'll need to switch to the `master` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Switch to the `master` branch.\n",
    "7. Look inside `README.md` (use `cat` or `vim` or whatever you prefer). You should see that this `README.md` is different than the one you just edited on your `feature_branch`.\n",
    "8. Now merge the commit from `feature_branch` into `master`.\n",
    "9. Poke around a little bit now. Make the following observations:\n",
    "    * What message did `git` output after you did the merge?\n",
    "    * Do a `git status` again. What does `git status` say about your local `master` branch relative to `origin/master`?\n",
    "    * Look inside `README.md`. What do you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pause. Now our `master` branch is up to date with our `feature_branch`. You can now delete the `feature_branch` since it is no longer relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Delete the `feature_branch`.\n",
    "11. Push your changes to your remote repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now you have a basic understanding of how to work with branches.  There is much more to learn, but these commands should get you going. You should really familiarize yourself with Chapter 3 of the [`Git` book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) for more details and workflow ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables\n",
    "* An updated `README.md` in your course repo.\n",
    "* The same `README.md` file should also be in your course repo in `pair_programming/PP3/`."

    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You already have experience with merge conflicts from the first homework assignment. Let's do it one more time under supervision, just a bit faster this time. After this, you're on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up\n",
    "\n",
    "Please add your breakout room partners as a collaborator on your `playground` repo. One of you should clone the other's `playground` repo. For example, suppose Sally and Joe decide to work together. Together, they decide that Joe will clone Sally's `playground` repo. This should be done in your own directory somewhere. It's up to you where, just try to be organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Some Changes\n",
    "Each partner should make some changes to the `playground` repo. The easiest way to do this to start will be to change the title of the `README.md` file. For the sake of the exercise, each partner should make the title of the `README.md` file something different. Feel free to do something more creative / interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder:** One partner will be working from their original `playground` repo while the other partner will be working from the newly cloned `playground` repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've each made the changes, please try to stage-commit-push. This should work without a problem for one of the partners. The other partner should get an error similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "To https://github.com/dsondak/playground.git\n",
    " ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)\n",
    "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dsondak/playground.git'\n",
    "hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do\n",
    "hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing\n",
    "hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes\n",
    "hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\n",
    "hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second partner realizes that they've made a mistake.  **Always** fetch and merge (or pull) from the remote repo before doing your work for the day or pushing your recent changes.  However, perhaps you're a little nervous since it only took you a minute to make your changes. You should realize that someone else probably did a push in the meantime. Nevertheless, you decide to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resolving Some Conflicts\n",
    "The partner who failed to push should try to do a `fetch-merge` sequence. Try out the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git fetch\n",
    "git merge origin/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "Think about what these commands are doing!  Can you explain them? Try to explain to your partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get an error message similar to: **(Note: Take a screenshot of this conflict message and name it exercise_2.png)**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Auto-merging intro.md\n",
    "CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in intro.md\n",
    "Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "From https://github.com/dsondak/playground\n",
    "   999fd74..2658cab  master     -> origin/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a conflict in `intro.md` [in this particular example, but yours might be slightly different] and `git` can't figure out how to resolve the conflict automatically.  It doesn't know who's right. Instead, `git` produces a file that contains information about the conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do a `cat` on the conflicted file.  You should see something like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "<<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "# A Project by Joe\n",
    "=======\n",
    "# A Project by Sally\n",
    ">>>>>>> origin/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The partner with the conflict knows that their partner is working on the same project as they are (they're teammates) so don't be alarmed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolve the conflict\n",
    "Talk to your partner and decide on a new title for the `README.md` file. Update the file and do a stage-commit-push sequence (with a good commit message!!) to update the remote repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merge conflict has been resolved!  Of course, the other parter's local repo doesn't yet know about what just happened. They need to `fetch` and `merge` to get the updates.  **Do this now!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see output similar to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Updating 2658cab..51c6b05\n",
    "Fast-forward\n",
    " intro.md | 2 +-\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)\n",
    "From https://github.com/dsondak/playground\n",
    "   2658cab..51c6b05  master     -> origin/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observe:** This is reporting a *fast-forward* operation.  Why wasn't there another merge conflict?  Please explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what actually happened here?\n",
    "[Note:  We'll use Joe and Sally to explain what's going on for clarity.]\n",
    "\n",
    "And as expected, `git` knows how to resolve this conflict. The reason `git` can resolve this conflict even though the files differ on the same line is that `git` has the commit history, too. When Sally made their original commit, they were given a commit hash (starting with 2658cab). When Joe resolved the merge conflict, Joe created a new commit hash (51c6b05) which unified the changes in commit 2658cab (Sally's original commit) and commit 3b934ee (Joe's original commit). Then, when Joe pushed, all of this information was given to the upstream repository. So `git` has a record stating that the merge resolution commit 51c6b05 is a subsequent commit to Sally's original changes in 2658cab. When Sally `fetch`ed the upstream repo, Sally got this information, too. So when Sally executed a `merge`, Sally was merging a predecessor (2658cab) with its direct successor (51c6b05), which `git` handles simply by using the successor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky conflict resolution that Joe did was effectively a way of taking two separate branches and tying them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One more note on binary files\n",
    "A problem that students sometimes run into occurs when they try to update their local repo from another repo _after_ some changes to a `.pdf` file have been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the big lessons here is that versioning binary files with `git` requires some special tools.  In this case, the binary file was a `.pdf` document.  In another case it may be an executable file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why binary files are difficult to version is because `git` must store the entire file again after each commit.  This is essentially a consequence of the fact that there is no clear way to `diff` binary files.  Hence, the `merg`ing operation has problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is extensive information around for the special tools `git` has for working with binary files.  For the particular case of `.pdf` files, you can use some special arguments to the `git checkout` command.  A nice discussion can be found at [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/278081/resolving-a-git-conflict-with-binary-files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/278081/resolving-a-git-conflict-with-binary-files).\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation is that you try to stay away from versioning binary files.  I put them up on `git` because I will not be changing the lectures slides much (if at all) over the course of the semester and because the lecture slides do not take up much space (and will therefore not have much of an effect on the speed of `git`). In fact, it is generally best practice to update your `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository to ignore binary files altogether.\n",
