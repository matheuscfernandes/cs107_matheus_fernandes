    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Create an iterable named `Fibonacci` and an iterator named `FibonacciIterator`. The `Fibonacci` iterable should be used to create a `FibonacciIterator` of a specified number of terms. The `FibonacciIterator` should iterate over the Fibonacci sequence and return the next value in the sequence. Here's a basic use case with some output:\n",

    "fib = Fibonacci(10) # Create a Fibonacci iterator called fib that contains 10 terms\n",
