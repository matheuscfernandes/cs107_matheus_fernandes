    "1. Make sure your course repo is named `cs107_firstname_lastname`.  If you have already done this, then you're done and you can skip to Step 2.  If not, here's how you can rename your repo:<br>\n",
    "    1. Go to your `GitHub` repo and click on the `Settings` tab.  Change the name under `Repository name`.\n",
    "    2. Now go to the local copy of your repository. For the sake of the example, say that you called this `cs107work`.\n",
    "    3. Type `git remote set-url origin *url to your repo*` where `*url to your repo*` will be something like `https://github.com/github_username/cs107_firstname_lastname.git`.  What you just did was change the url of the remote repository.  Recall that `origin` is the short name of your remote repository.\n",
    "    4. As a sanity check, type `git remote -v`.  It should list the correct url now.\n",
    "    5. Finally, your directory should be updated to avoid any future confusion.\n",
    "        * To navigate up one directory, type `cd ..`.\n",

    "2. Within your `homework/` directory, create subdirectory `HW1/`.  \n",
    "3. Under the `HW1/` directory, create subdirectory `HW1-final/`.  \n",
    "4. Only files within `HW1-final/` will be graded. \n",

Often times a project might be spun off an existing repo and take on a life of its own (e.g. Ubuntu is a fork of the Linux project). The fork may still contribute back to the original project from time to time, but it is usually meant to be an entirely new project. Branches on the other hand are meant to be confined within a single repo.\n",

    "\n",
    "This extra set of exercises is for your reference in case you don't have much experience with Unix.  *Please* do your best to become comfortable with the command line throughout the semester.  There are plenty of resources available on learning how to use the command line efficiently.  Here is one to get you started: [http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php#contents](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php#contents).\n",
    "\n",
    "Macs come with a command line app (terminal.app) and since Macs are loosely similar to [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), the terminal commands are pretty much the same as those in [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions.  Windows is a bit different, and because of this, I had you install *git BASH* if you are using a Windows machine.  What this means is that, even if you are using a Windows OS, you can still use the nice Unix commands as long as you are in the git BASH terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that there are various options for using `git` from the Desktop (e.g. see [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)).  However, it is more useful for you to be able to do things from the command line.  The reasons for this are that the command line is not going anywhere any time soon and that I can't predict what GUI your future company/group will want you to use.  You'll be much more versatile using the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that you need to learn a little bit about how to navigate with the command line.  There are a few essential commands that you absolutely **must** know.  You'll pick up the rest as you go through your life.  Here are the essential ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ls**: list the contents of the current directory\n",
    "* **cd**: change to a new directory\n",
    "* **mv**: rename a directory or file OR move a directory or file to a new location\n",
    "* **cp**: copy a directory or file\n",
    "* **pwd**: print the working directory\n",
    "* **mkdir**: create a new directory\n",
    "* **rm**: remove a file (you can remove a directory with rm -r)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to work with these a bit.  In the following steps, you should hit the `return` key after typing each command.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up a terminal and type `pwd`.  The output should be your home directory.\n",
    "2. Next type `ls`.  You should see all the files and directories in your home directory.  Notice that if you type `ls -l` you get a list with more information where the files and directories are ordered alphabetically.  Typing `ls -lt` sorts the list by date/time created with the most recent file/directory at the top.  `ls -ltr` just reverses the order of the sort; now the most recent file/directory is at the bottom.\n",
    "3. Now type `mkdir mydir`.  Voila!  You have just created a new directory.  Try `ls` again.  Do you see the new directory?\n",
    "4. To enter that directory type `cd mydir`.  You just changed into your new directory.  Type `pwd` to see where you are.\n",
    "5. Now that you're inside your new directory, let's create a file in there.\n",
    "  * Type `echo 'Hello world!' > newfile.txt`\n",
    "  * Type `ls`.  You should see the next text file!\n",
    "  * To see the contents of the file, type `cat newfile.txt`.\n",
    "6. Suppose you now want to rename `newfile.txt` to `README.txt`.  Just execute `mv newfile.txt README.txt`.  Type `ls` again if you wish.\n",
    "7. Maybe you really wanted to keep a copy of `newfile.txt`.  Just do `cp README.txt newfile.txt`.  As usual, `ls` will show you what you want to see.\n",
    "8. What if `newfile.txt` should actually be in a different directory?  Let's do the following:\n",
    "  * `mkdir newdir`\n",
    "  * `mv newfile.txt newdir/`\n",
    "  * Altneratively, you could give the entire path of the new directory (not necessary here).  Here's how you would do that:\n",
    "    - `pwd` (just to see the current path)\n",
    "    - `mv newfile.txt path_from_pwd/newdir/`\n",
    "9.  That was fun, but this directory is completely useless to use now.  Let's delete it.\n",
    "  * First, you need to get out of the current directory.  You can't delete a directory from within it!\n",
    "  * To go up one directory, just type `cd ..`.\n",
    "     - **Unix Note:** In Unix, `.` stands for the current directory and `..` stands for the parent directory (that is, the directory containing the current directory.  Hence, `cd ../` changes to the parent directory of the current directory.\n",
    "     - **Unix Note:** If you want to go up two directories, just do `cd ../../`.  You can use the same pattern for $n$ directories.\n",
    "  * Now type `rm mydir`.  You should see the message `rm: mydir/: is a directory`. `rm` cannot be used to remove directories as-is.  It can only remove files.\n",
    "  * To remove the directory type `rm -rv mydir`.  The `-r` option says to recursively remove the directory and any contents.  The `-v` option says to be verbose while removing files.  You don't really need the `-v` option, but I like use it so I can see progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a whirlwind tour through a few of the more useful Unix commands.  It won't take you long to use them effectively, but *you must use them*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you want more information about any command, just type `man command_name` into the terminal.  This will bring up the manual page for that command. You will see all sorts of information. To scroll down, just hit the `space bar`. To exit the `man page` just type `q` (for quit). Here's an example of a portion of the `man page` for the `rm` command:\n",
    "![rm man page](../fig/rm_man_page.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Command\n",
    "Suppose you want to copy a file from a different location to your current directory.  Well, recall that the current directory is represented by the `.` object.  Here are a few things you can do:\n",
    "* `cp path_to_file/file .`: Will copy file to your current location\n",
    "* `cp path_to_file/file ./sub_dir`:  Will copy file to the directory `sub_dir` in your current location\n",
    "* `cp ../file .`:  Will copy file from the parent directory to your current location\n",
