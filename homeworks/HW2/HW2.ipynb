    "\n",
    "<a id='p1'></a>\n",
    "### Problem 1 [15 pts]: Understanding Remotes\n",
    "Remotes are an important concept in `git`.  Being a *decentralized version control system*, `git` allows each user to have the entire history of the project locally.  This means that you can develop anywhere you want (e.g. an airplane over the ocean!).  It also means that you have to be comfortable working with repos from other people; not just a central repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea here is that of remote repositories.  You have probably noticed by now that `git` has names such as `origin` and `master`.  The name `origin` refers to the name of the remote repository while the name `master` refers to the name of the `branch`.  Repositories can have many branches.  You can create references to other repositories (called remotes) within your current repository and customize the names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete this problem in your course repo in the `HW2/` directory on the `HW2-dev` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following steps:\n",
    "1. Type `git remote -v` and take a screenshot.  Save it as `P1_1.png`, put it in your `HW2-final/` directory, commit the changes to your local repo, and push the changes to `origin`.\n",
    "2. Add your `playground` repository as a remote.  Use the command `git remote add remote_name remote_url` where `remote_name` should be replaced with the alias of the remote repo and `remote_url` should be replaced with the url to the remote repo.  You can name the remote whatever you want.  In the rest of this exercise, we will refer to the playground remote name as `my_name`.\n",
    "3. Type `git remote -v` and take a screenshot.  Save it as `P1_3.png` and put it in your `HW2-final/` directory, commit the changes to your local repo, and push the changes to `origin`.\n",
    "4. Now create a remote to the course playground (`cs107-sys-dev/playground`). No need to take a screenshot this time.\n",
    "5. Next `fetch` the changes from the remote course playground.\n",
    "6. Try out the `git remote show my_name` command.  How useful!  This is a good thing to check before blindly merging.\n",
    "7. Now `merge` the changes into your local cs107 repo on the `HW2-dev` branch (this should go smoothly because you shouldn't have any of the files yet so there's really nothing to merge).\n",
    "  * Note that Steps 5 and 7 could have been combined with a `git pull remote_name branch_name` command, where `branch_name` should be replaced with the branch that you want to pull from.  It's good to get in the habit of first fetching and then merging; this helps enforce good practices.\n",
    "  * **Hint:** Because your `playground` and course repos are not related, they have different `git` histories.  `git` automatically rejects merges of repos with different histories.  However, for this problem we will override that behavior.  Try using the option `--allow-unrelated-histories`.\n",
    "  * **Hint:**  You *may* need to resolve a merge conflict.  In case you do, it's best to retain whatever was in your course repo (instead of what was in the playground).\n",
    "8. Show the status of your repo with the appropriate `git` command.  Take a screenshot, save it as `P1_8.png`, and put it in your `HW2-final/` directory.\n",
    "9. Commit the changes to your local repo.\n",
    "10. Push the changes to your remote course repo (probably named `origin`).\n",
    "11. **Optional** Rename the remote with the command `git remote rename my_name new_name`, where `new_name` should be replaced by the new alias that you want to use.  Remove the remote with `git remote remove my_name`.\n",

    "### Problem 2 [20 pts]: DNA complement\n",
    "Much of biology and bioinformatics depends on understanding and manipulating long sequences of DNA. A common thing to look at would be the complement of a given sequence. \n",
    "Recall that DNA has 4 bases: `A`,`T`,`G`,`C`.  DNA sequences are described by a concatenation of these letters.  For example, a DNA sequence might have the form `AATGGC`.  The complement of the base `A` is the base `T` and the complement of the base `G` is the base `C`.  The DNA complement of `AATGGC` is therefore `TTACCG`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function that accepts a string of arbitrary length representing a DNA sequence and returns the corresponding DNA complement, also as a string. Please put this function in a file called `P2.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Design Considerations and Requirements\n",
    "* Name your function `dna_complement` and have it take in a DNA sequence as input. This input should be a string.\n",
    "* You must handle the situation in which the input string is either empty or does not contain characters corresponding to the real DNA bases. If either of these situations arise, please have your function return `None`.\n",
    "* Your function should be case-agnostic. This means that the input string to the function can be any case. However, your function must return the DNA complement in upper case.\n",
    "* Demo your function. You should do this in the same file in which the function is defined (`P2.py`). The demo should do the following:\n",
    "    * Print out an example input string. You can choose whatever example you want. \n",
    "    * Call the function that you just defined\n",
    "    * Print out the output string that you get from your function.\n",
    "* Repeat the demo with an invalid DNA string (containing characters other than ATGC).\n",
    "* These two demos will take a total of six lines of code in your `P2.py` file after the definition of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** Assume that the DNA sequence is provided in the file. There is no need to have the user input the string on the command line. \n",

    "### Problem 3 [25 pts]: Simple Bank Account Withdraw System\n",

    "* You should check for basic exceptions (e.g. attempting to withdraw more than the current balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you write your functions, demo them as follows to see if it behaves as expected for two consecutive withdrawls:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Notes:** \n",
    "* The explanation can be entered as a `Python` string in your demo script and printed out to the screen.\n",
    "* Feel free to put the explanation _above_ the demo.  Otherwise the `Python` exception handler will kill the script before your explanation gets printed out.

    "\n",
    "Add this explanation to your `P3a.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b).**\n",
    "Now let's fix P3a. You can fix things up by updating `balance` within the inner function.  But this won't work.  Try it out and explain why it doesn't work.  Try to use the language that we used in lecture.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Before presenting the requirements for your code, let's review some clock anatomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clock Anatomy\n",
    "The hands of a clock can be defined by two points. The first point is given by the origin $\\left(0, 0\\right)$. The second point will be somewhere on a circle. Precisely where on the circle depends on the time of day and the clock hand that we're thinking about (hour, minute, second). The time of day can be converted to the degrees of a circle (or an angle). For example, we're used to looking at a clock with 12 at the very top of the circle. In our minds, this corresponds to $0^{\\circ}$. From this perspective, 3:00 in the afternoon corresponds to $90^{\\circ}$. A few hours on the clock correspond to the following angles (in degrees):\n",
    "\n",
    "|               |                  |                \n",
    "| :---:         | :---:            | :---:                        \n",
    "| *Time*                         | 12:00     | 3:00     | 6:00     | 9:00\n",
    "| *$\\theta$ (${}^{\\circ}$)*      | 0         | 90       | 180      | 270             \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you should be able to see that each hour represents $30^{\\circ}$. And so, in degrees on a clock, we have,\n",
    "$$\\theta = 30t_{h}$$\n",
    "where $t_{h}$ is the hour. Of course, this is at odds with the usual mathematical definition. In mathematics, we would expect 3:00 to be at $0^{\\circ}$ and 12:00 to be at $90^{\\circ}$. Let's introduce a shift to fix this,\n",
    "$$\\theta = 90 - 30t_{h}.$$\n",
    "Do you understand what happened here? There is one more little modification that can be done, which will help the readability of the hour hand. Since each hour consists of thirty degrees, we can have the hour hand move a little bit each minute to help it slide along between two hours. This can be accomplished by recognizing that there are $60$ minutes in an hour. Hence, at the first minute of an hour, the hour hand should be pointing directly to the hour that just started. At minute $60$, the hour hand should be pointing to the next hour, which means that it will have passed through $30^{\\circ}$. Hence, the angle of the hour hand is given by,\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\theta = 90 - 30t_{h} - \\frac{t_{m}}{2}}.$$\n",
    "where $t_{m}$ represents the minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know the angle that the hour hand has moved through, you're just about ready to calculate its $(x,y)$ position. Remember, this is the second point on the line. You just need to do two things:\n",
    "1. Define the length of the line by some parameter $r$. You choose this parameter! It just tells you how big the hour hand is. \n",
    "2. Convert $\\theta$ to radians: $\\theta_h =  \\dfrac{\\pi}{180}\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the $(x,y)$ coordinates are given by,\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "  x &= r\\cos\\left(\\theta_h\\right) \\\\\n",
    "  y &= r\\sin\\left(\\theta_h\\right).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Now you're ready to plot a line representing the hour hand!\n",
    "\n",
    "The minute and second hands are much easier. The angles that the minute hand and second hand pass through are\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\theta = 90 - 6t_{m}}$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\\boxed{\\theta = 90 - 6t_{s}},$$\n",
    "respectively, where $t_{s}$ is the seconds. You can compute the $\\left(x,y\\right)$ coordinates of each hand the same way as you did with the hour hand. Just choose a length $r$ and convert to radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Clock Hand Closure\n",
    "Write a closure with the following API:\n",
    "* The outer function should take in a single float representing the length of the clock hand. This is $r$ in the mathematics above.\n",
    "* The outer function should return an inner function like all good closures do.\n",
    "* The inner function should take in a single float representing the angle of the clock hand. This is $\\theta$ *in degrees* in the mathematics above.\n",
    "* The inner function should return the $\\left(x,y\\right)$ coordinate of the clock hand on the circle.\n",
    "    * Don't forget to convert to radians!\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate your closure in `P4.py` by doing the following:\n",
    "* Get the current date and time\n",
    "* Instantiate the clock hands using your closure. This should look similar to the following pseudo-code:\n",

    "import matplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "import datetime\n",
