    "You have used the `git revert` command a few times throughout this class. This problem will teach you how to revert multiple commits all in one shot, which can be very useful when you have made many changes that broke your code or accidentally merged a branch you did not want to.\n",

    "1. Start on your `HW3-dev` branch in your `HW3/` directory.\n",
    "    1. Make a file called `hello.txt` with one line that says `This is //your_name//.` Try using the `echo` command on this file to verify the content.\n",

    "    5. Verify that `hello.txt` is deleted and that your `HW3-P1` branch is 2 commits ahead of `HW3-dev`.\n",
    "3. Switch back to your `HW3-dev` branch.\n",
    "    1. Verify that your `hello.txt` says `This is //your_name//.` **Why is this the case?** Make sure you understand this. You do not need to submit an answer. \n",
    "    2. Merge your `HW3-P1` branch into `HW3-dev`.\n",

But what if you decide that you did not want to delete `hello.txt` or change your name in `hello.txt`? This is where the `git revert` command is useful to reverse our history while still preserving the log!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Verify that you're on your `HW3-dev` branch.\n",
    "5. Find the SHA for the commit that you made when you changed the name in `hello.txt`. If you are unfamiliar with git commit SHAs, [this is a quick read](https://blog.thoughtram.io/git/2014/11/18/the-anatomy-of-a-git-commit.html) to get you up-to-speed.\n",
    "6. Find the SHA for the commit that you made when you deleted `hello.txt`.\n",
    "7. Now, we want you to use the `git revert` command to reverse the changes of your two commits and **then make only one additional commit with the reverted changes.** The message for your single commit should read something like `P1 - reverted deletion of hello.txt and name change`.\n",
    "    1. Explore the `git revert` command (use the `-h` flag or Google) to figure out a way you can revert the changes of your two previous commits and then commit the revisions in a single commit.\n",
    "    2. If you use `git revert older_commit_SHA^..newer_commit_SHA`, then you will make two additional commits to revert your changes. **This IS NOT what we want.**\n",
    "    3. **Hint:** Checkout this [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4991594/revert-a-range-of-commits-in-git).\n",
    "8. Your commit log on your `HW3-dev` branch should have a sequence of 4 commits very close to the screenshot below. Please take a screen shot of your 4 commits, name the screenshot `P1.png`, and submit it.\n",

    "### Explanation of Modules\n",
    "So far, we have only been writing short `Python` scripts. However, when your code base starts to get bigger, you might want to organize your function and class definitions. The idea behind modules is to split your function and class definitions into multiple, logical units.  When you want to use a function or class you simply import it from the module.  In essence, a module is a file containing `Python` definitions and statements.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**You are prohibited from using standard regression libraries in `Python` such as `sklearn`.**  These classes must be your own.  However, you *are permitted* to check your answers against the standard libraries. You may use `numpy` to perform simple computations such as computing averages."
