    "We have also now designated the `species` attribute as \"non-user-facing\" by calling it `_species` because we do not want the user to access it directly. However, this presents a problem because in our first version of the `Animal` class, a client could access the species through the `species` attribute. You can check that the attributes of the `Animal` class are `name` and `_species` using the following steps (on Python shell):\n",
    "```python\n",

    "In this part, we want to make our linked list immutable and we are not updating its head or tail after it's been created. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please implement the `append` method.\n",
    "This method appends a node holding the object `val` to a `LinkedList` and  returns the `LinkedList`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** It's recursive. We recursively invoke the `append` on the tail, the tail of the tail, and so on. While implementing, try to draw a schematic of what's going on step-by-step for each tail creation. This will give a clearer picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a price to pay for the immutability. If we want to append an element to this list, we will need to update the tail of the last `LinkedList` node, which breaks the immutability. Therefore, we need to re-create the last `LinkedList` node, but then we realize that we need to update the next-to-last `LinkedList` node by re-creating it as well and so on. It is essentially re-creating the whole new list with one more node. This is not very efficient. Fortunately, instead of appending an element to the end of this list, we can also prepend an element to the start of this list, which will be much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Please implement the `prepend` method in both the `LinkedList` and `Nil` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Both `append` and `prepend` return a new object without mutating the object passed to it (which is our linked list, the `self`). In this problem, rather than imagining `append` and `prepend` as operations done on the original linked list, we imagine `append` and `prepend` as pure functions that map some input (original linked list) to an output (a linked list extended by a new node).\n",

    "We want to be able to conveniently apply a function to all elements in this list. Please implement the `for_each` method (in both `LinkedList` and `Nil`), which takes a function `fun` as an argument, and returns a `LinkedList` (or a `Nil`) in which the element `e` in the list is mapped to `fun(e)`.

    "If we look at the logic of `summation` and `minimum`, we will notice that they are quite similar. Both are first *reducing* the tail of the list into an intermediate result and then *combining* the head with the intermediate result. The difference between `summation` and `minimum` lies in what this *combining* function is. For `summation`, two elements are combined by the function:\n",

    "The `put` method inserts a key-value pair into the `BSTTable`. It delegates the function call to `_put`. Please implement the non-public method `_put`. It takes a `node`, a `key`, and a `val` as arguments. `node` is the root of the subtree into which the key-value pair is to be inserted. After the insertion, the root of this subtree may change. `_put` should return the new root of this subtree. The difference of the input subtree and the returned subtree is that in the returned subtree, a new key-value pair has been inserted. If the key was already in the subtree, then we update the value of the corresponding node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We assume all the keys are of the same type and are comparable to each other with `>`, `<` and `==`. So if all your keys are strings (e.g. `greektoroman`), they will be ordered lexicographically. If all your keys are numbers, they will be ordered from the smallest to the largest. \n",

    "**Hints:** \n",
    "* This is recursive.\n",
    "* Think about the base case: what should be returned if the `node` passed in is `None`? \n",
    "* Which subtree (left/right) should we insert if the `node` is not `None`? \n",
    "* Remember to update the `size` of the nodes.\n",
    "    - The `size` attribute of each `BSTNode` is the size of this subtree, i.e. the number of nodes including itself and all its descendants.\n",

    "The `get` method returns the value with the corresponding key. It delegates the function call to `_get`. Please implement the non-public method `_get`. It takes a `node` and a `key` as an argument. It will search for a node with the same key under the subtree whose root is `node`. If there is such a node, return the `val` of this node. `_get` should raise a `KeyError` if no such node is found.\n",
