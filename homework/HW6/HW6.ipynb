    "This question is all about the binary heap data structure. A (binary) heap is a (nearly) complete binary tree; this means all of it's non-leaf nodes have exactly two children which makes it suitable to store in a compact and memory efficient array. Each node of the tree is an element in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two types of binary heaps are: *min-heap* and *max-heap*. The **heap-property** is the most important invariant that holds at every node in the tree and is dependent on the type of heap we consider. In a *min-heap* the heap-property states:\n",
    "- In an array-backed min-heap, $A$, the following relation holds for every node (other than the root), $A[i]$: $A[Parent(i)] \\leq A[i]$\n",
    "- the root is the minimum element of the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "For a *max-heap*, the above comparison between parent ($A[Parent(i)]$) and child node ($A[i]$) is reversed and the root represents the tree's maximum element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your objective** by the end of the question is to implement a binary max- and min-heap that support the following operations:\n",
    "- `heapify`: maintains the max/min-heap property\n",
    "- `build_heap`: turns an unordered array into a valid max/min-heap\n",

    "# Problem 3 [30 pts]: Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue is an abstract data type that represents a set of elements where each element has some key associated with it (a *priority*). Dequeueing (i.e., removing) an element from the priority queue will return the element with highest (in a max-priority queue) or lowest (in a min-priority queue) key. Thus removing all elements of the priority queue will leave you with a sorted list. A priority queue gets its name from the fact that elements are inserted or removed with priority over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our priority queue should support following three operations:\n",
    "1. **put**: add an element to the set\n",
    "2. **get**: retrieve and remove the element with the largest key (or smallest depending on the type of priority queue)\n",
    "3. **peek**: this should return the largest element (or smallest depending on the type of priority queue)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our priority queue implementation, the key of an element will be the element itself. In a min-priority queue, an element, X, has a *higher priority* compared to element, Y, if `X < Y`. Examples:\n",
    "* `1 < 3` is `True`, so we assume `1` has higher priority\n",
    "* `'beef pho' < 'chicken pho'` is `True` (Python compares strings with lexicographical order), so we assume `'beef pho'` has higher priority\n",
    "* `(1685, 'pho') < (1862, 'rice')` is `True` (Python compares tuples position by position), so we assume `(1685, 'pho')` has higher priority.\n",
