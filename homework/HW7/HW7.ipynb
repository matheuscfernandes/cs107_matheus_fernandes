    "## Problem 1: Weather Prediction Using a Markov Chain [45 pts]\n",
    "[Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are widely used to model and predict discrete events. \n",
    "Underlying Markov chains are Markov processes which make the assumption that the outcome of a future event only depends on the event immediately preceding it. \n",
    "In this problem, we will use a Markov chain to create a basic model for predicting the weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='p1a'></a>\n",
    "### Part A: Implement a Markov chain [10 pts]\n",
    "**You will complete this part in the files `Markov.py` and `P1A.py`.**\n",
    "#### Example: Toy weather model\n",
    "To begin, let us consider how we can represent weather behaviour as a Markov chain by considering a toy weather model in which the weather behaviour follows the following rules:\n",
    "1. A dry day has $0.9$ probability of being followed by a sunny day, and otherwise transitions into a humid day. \n",
    "2. A humid day as $0.5$ probability of being followed by a dry day, and otherwise remains humid. \n",
    "3. A sunny day has $0.4$ probability of remaining sunny, and otherwise an equal probability of transitioning to a dry day or humid day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the preceding rules can be represented in a Markov chain as follows:\n",
    "![Toy Markov](../fig/toy_markov.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And a transition matrix $P$ of the form: \n",
    "$$\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "                  & \\text{Dry} & \\text{Humid} & \\text{Sunny} \\\\ \n",
    "     \\text{Dry}   & 0          & 0.1          & 0.9          \\\\ \n",
    "     \\text{Humid} & 0.5        & 0.5          & 0            \\\\ \n",
    "     \\text{Sunny} & 0.3        & 0.3          & 0.4          \\end{matrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each matrix element $P_{ij}$ is the probability the weather on the next day is of the $j$-th weather type given that the current day is of the $i$-th weather type (e.g. $P_{dry, humid} = 0.1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to calculate the weather probability $N$ days from the current day, we simply sum the probabilities of the conditional events given in the matrix.\n",
    "For example, given that the current day is dry ($i = 1$), the probability of it being humid ($j = 2$) in $N=2$ days is \n",
    "$$\\left(M^{2}\\right)_{12} = P_{11} P_{12} + P_{12} P_{22} + P_{13} P_{32}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your task: Modified toy weather model\n",
    "In reality, there is a much broader range of weather conditions than just *dry*, *humid*, and *sunny*. Your task is to create a modified version of the toy model above to account for a slightly broader range of weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `weather.csv` file accompanying this homework, each row corresponds to one type of weather in the following order.\n",
    "1. sunny \n",
    "2. cloudy \n",
    "3. rainy \n",
    "4. snowy \n",
    "5. windy\n",
    "6. hailing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each column gives the probability of one type of weather occuring the following day (also in the order above). \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the example, the $(i, j)$ element is the probability that the $j$-th weather type occurs after the $i$-th weather type; e.g. the $(1, 2)$ element is the probability that a cloudy day occurs after the sunny day.\n",
    "Take a look at the data and verify that if the current day is sunny ($i=1$) the following day will have a $0.4$ probability of being sunny ($j=1$) as well, whereas if the current day is rainy ($i=3$) the following day has a probability $0.05$ of being windy ($j=5$). (You do not need to submit anything for this step; this is just to check that the data is structured as described.)"

    "\n",
    "**You will complete this part in the file `Markov.py.`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are a convenient way to walk along your Markov chain. Create a `MarkovIterator` class and implement the `__init__()`,  `__iter__()`, and `__next__()` methods. Then, go back to `Markov` class you implemented in the preceding part and implement `__iter__()` method that returns a `MarkovIterator`object. \n",
    "The specifications are as follows: \n",
    "* For the `Markov` class\n",
    "    - `__iter__()` should call `MarkovIterator()` and return the iterator object\n",
    "        - The exact syntax of calling `MarkovIterator()` will be determined by how you implement `MarkovIterator`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint_**: `self.get_prob()` might come in handy here. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For the `MarkovIterator` class\n",
    "    - `__init__()` should have some useful attributes that would help you to implement the `__next__()` method below \n",
    "    - `__iter__()` should return self\n",
    "    - `__next__()` should return the next day's weather \n",
    "        - Each next day's weather should be stochastic. \n",
    "      That is, it is randomly selected based on the relative probabilities of the the next day's weather types given the current day's weather type. \n",
    "      The next day's weather should be returned as a **lowercase string** (e.g. `'sunny'`) rather than an index (e.g. 0).\n",
    "        - Once the $ (n) $ th day's weather is sampled, it will affect the underlying probability for $ (n+1) $ th day's weather prediction. An instance of `MarkovIterator` should be able to keep track of either one of or both the current day's predicted weather and the presumed probability distribution. \n",
    "      \n",
    "**_Hint_**: You may use Python's built-in `random.choices` function or NumPy's `numpy.random.choice` function to select the next day's weather based on the relevant relative probabilities. Think of what the function of your choice takes as an argument, and that will help you decide what attributes `MarkovIterator.__init__()` needs. "

    "**You will complete this part in the files `Markov.py` and `P1C.py`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will predict what the weather will be like in a week for five different cities given each city's current weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate predictions for a city's weather in seven days by using the `Markov` iterator implemented in the previous part. \n",
    "To do so, make the following modifications to your `Markov` class:\n",
    "* Modify `__init__` such that it accepts an optional argument `day_zero_weather` (with default value `None`) which is the weather of the current day, and stores it as the instance variable `day_zero_weather`. \n",
    "* Implement the method `_simulate_weather_for_day(day)`, where `day` is a non-negative integer representing the number of days from the current day.  This method returns the predicted weather as a string on the specified day.\n",
    "  * **Hint:** Make sure that your method returns a sensible result (i.e. the current day's weather) for `day = 0`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "For the purposes of this problem, rather than just producing just one simulation per city, we would like to simulate **100 such predictions** per city, and store the most commonly occuring predictions. \n",
    "To that end, please implement `get_weather_for_day`, which uses `_simulate_weather_for_day` to run the simulation for `trials` number of times:\n",
    "* `get_weather_for_day(day, trials)`: Returns list of strings of length `trials` where each element is the predicted weather for each trial. **Assign a default value to `trials`.** `day` is an integer representing how far from the current day we want to predict the weather. For example, if `day=3`, then we want to predict the weather on day 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, because things are stochastic, predicting the weather a few days from now cannot be perfectly accurate.  What makes more sense would be to predict the weather a few days from now a bunch of times. From the sampling, you can make a most likely prediction on the weather a few days away from day 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint_**: You  <span style=\"color:red\"> <b> must use the iterator </b> </span> to complete this part of the problem. You may find it helpful to define new instance variables `self._current_day` and `self._current_day_weather`, which keep track of the current day number (starting from `0`) and its weather. This means that you need to make use of methods (__next__ and/or __iter__) you implemented in Part B to simulate the weather of a given day instead of raising the transition matrix to a certain power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint_**: You may also find it helpful to define a helper method to reset the `self._current_day` and `self._current_day_weather` for each new simulation trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**\n",
    "* Modify the `Markov` class `__init__` method to accept an optional argument `day_zero_weather`.\n",
    "* Implement `_simulate_weather_for_day(day)` method, which returns predicted weather on day `day`.\n",
    "* Implement `get_weather_for_day(day, trials)` method, which returns the predicted weather over `trials` simulations as a list (of strings).\n",

    "Print the number of occurrences of each weather condition over the 100 trials for each city, e.g.\n",
    "```\n",
    "New York: {'hailing': 6, 'sunny': 36, ...}\n",
    "Chicago: {'cloudy': 33, 'snowy': 11, ...}\n",

You will need to run a dummy `fit` on this object before you are able to manually overwrite the relevant variables.\n",
