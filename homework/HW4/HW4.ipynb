    "### Part A: Write a Numerical Differentiation Closure\n",
    "Write a closure called `numerical_diff` which takes as inputs a function (of a single variable) `f` and a value of `h` and returns a function which takes as input a value of `x` that computes the numerical approximation of the derivative of `f` with stepsize `h` at `x`.\n",

    "### Part B: Compare the Finite Difference to the True Derivative\n",
    "Let $f(x) = \\ln(x)$ and let $f^{\\prime}\\left(x\\right)$ denote the first derivative of $f\\left(x\\right)$. Use your closure from Part A to compute $f^{\\prime}_{FD}\\left(x\\right)$ for $0.2 \\leq x \\leq 0.4$ for $h=1\\times 10^{-1}$, $h=1\\times 10^{-7}$, and $h=1\\times 10^{-15}$. Compare $f^{\\prime}_{FD}\\left(x\\right)$ at the different values of $h$ to the exact derivative. Save your plot as `P1_fig.png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- Compute the exact derivative explicitly.\n",
    "- Your plot should be readable and interpretable (i.e., you should include axis labels and a legend). You may need to change the line style for all lines to be visible.\n",

    "## Problem 2: A Neural Network, Forward Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks take as input the values of an input layer of neurons and combine these inputs in a series of layers to compute an output.  A small network with a single hidden layer is drawn below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NN](../fig/NNFigNoPhi.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "The above graph helps us visualize the computation in different layers.  This visualization hides many of the underlying operations which occur in the computation of $f$ (e.g. it does not explicitly express the elementary operations).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Tasks\n",
    "In this part, you will completely neglect the biases, $b_{i}$ and $b_{\\text{out}}$.  The mathematical form is therefore $$f\\left(x,y\\right) = w_{\\text{out}}^{T}z\\left(W\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}\\right).$$  Note that in practical applications the biases play a key role.  However, we have elected to neglect them in this problem so that your results are more readable.  You will complete the two steps below while neglecting the bias terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we have done in lecture, draw the complete forward graph.  You may treat $z$ as a single elementary operation. Submit a picture of the graph as `P2_graph.png`.  This picture can be a picture taken of your graph drawn on a piece of paper or it can be something that you draw electronically.\n",
    "2. Use your graph to write out the full forward mode table and submit a picture of the table as `P2_table.png`.  This table can, once again, be done on a piece of paper or in markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission Notes:\n",
    "- For the graph, you should explicitly show the multiplications and additions that are masked in the schematic of the network above.\n",
    "- You should relabel the nodes of the graph with traces (e.g. $x_{13}$) as we have done in class.\n",
    "- Your table should include columns for the trace, elementary function, current function value, elementary function derivative, partial x derivative, and partial y derivative.  Here is an example table with a row filled in (**Note:** Your table will not contain this exact row.  Your table will have something else for $x_{4}$.)\n",

    "This problem provides you with a tool to help visualize automatic differentiation.  This automatic differentiation code base and GUI originated as the fall 2018 CS207 final project extension for Lindsey Brown, Xinyue Wang, and Kevin Yoon, and it has undergone further development. It is meant to be a resource for you as you learn automatic differentiation.\n",

    "### Part A: Preview of Virtual Environments\n",
    "In lecture, we will be learning about how to use virtual environments to create workspaces to use only certain packages.  For this problem, we will walk through how to set up a virtual environment using `conda` to create a workspace to contain a GUI to help with the visualization of the automatic differentiation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a virtual environment.  Use the command `conda create -n env_name python=3.6 anaconda` where `env_name` is a name of your choosing for your virtual environment.\n",
    "2. Activate your virtual environment, using `source activate env_name`.\n",
    "   - Note:  Some systems might given an error here and ask you to execute a different sequence of commands.  If this happens, please follow the commands suggested in your terminal.\n",
    "3. Clone the Auto-eD repository: `git clone https://github.com/lindseysbrown/Auto-eD.git`.\n",

    "For this part, we will use the simplified neural network model (no bias terms) from Problem 2 again.  For this part only (Problem 3B), take $w_{out} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$, $W = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.1 & 1.2 \\\\ 2.1 & 2.2 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $z$ to be the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so you'll be inputing $f(x,y)$ into either the command line (option A) or the GUI (option B), so you will need $f(x,y)$ in scalar form. (Hint:  This should be the last line of your evaluation table.) **Do not simplify by multiplying the weights togther.  Each of the 6 constants should appear in the function expression exactly once.**  This will look strange, but it is the way that you should do the problem.\n",

    "#### Option A: Run Auto-eD Locally\n",
    "1.  Run the file using `python ADappHeroku.py`. If you get a `ImportError: Python is not installed as a framework.` error, try running `pythonw ADappHeroku.py`instead.\n",
    "2. Go to `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` in your web browser\n",
    "3.  Follow the input instructions.  You are free to choose any $x$ and $y$ value at which to evaluate the function and its derivatives.\n",
    "4.  Save the reverse mode graph as `P3_graph.png`.\n",
    "5.  Deactivate your virtual environment using `conda deactivate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option B: Use the Website\n",
    "**Note:**  Due to server limitations, the Auto-eD website only allows for a low number of simultaneous sessions, so there may be errors or latency. We'd prefer you ran the package locally.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Handle exceptions appropriately.\n",
    "  - This is a good place to use (and practice) duck-typing.  For example, rather than checking if an argument to a special method is an instance of the object, instead use a `try-except` block, catch an `AttributeError` and do the appropriate calculation.\n",

    "## Problem 5 [15 pts]: Continuous Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You will not be able to start this problem until after lecture 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed documentation and testing in lecture (or will very soon) and also briefly touched on code coverage.  You must write tests for your code in your final project (and in life).  There is a nice way to automate the testing process called continuous integration (CI). This problem will walk you through the basics of CI and show you how to get up and running with some CI software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind continuous integration is to automate aspects of the testing process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow goes something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You work on your part of the code in your own branch or fork.\n",
    "2. On every commit you make and push to GitHub, your code is automatically tested by an external service (e.g. Travis CI). This ensures that there are no specific dependencies on the structure of your machine that your code needs to run and also ensures that your changes are sane.\n",
    "3. When you want to merge your changes with the master / production branch you submit a pull request to `master` in the main repo (the one you're hoping to contribute to). The repo manager creates a branch off `master`. \n",
    "4. This branch is also set to run tests on Travis. If all tests pass, then the pull request is accepted and your code becomes part of master.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will use GitHub to integrate our roots library with Travis CI and CodeCov. (Note that this is not the only workflow people use.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A:\n",
    "Create a **public** GitHub repo called `cs107test` and clone it to your local machine.  (**Note:** This should be done **outside** your course repo.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the example from lecture 13 to create a file called `roots.py`, which contains the `quad_roots` and `linear_roots` functions (along with their documentation). Now, also create a file called `test_roots.py`, which contains the tests from lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these files should be in your newly created `cs107test` repo.  **Don't push yet!!!**\n",
